JabRef's strength is that is has all tools to work with BibTeX and BibLaTeX.

Currently, JabRef offers the GUI (known as "JabRef", internally as "JabGUI") and a CLI application (known as "JabKit").

Recently, a library for creating Terminal UIs in Java was published: <https://melix.github.io/blog/2026/02/17-announcing-tamboui.html>.
One can try it out using `jbang demos@tamboui`.

There are terminal UIs for managing BibTeX available. For instance [bibiman](https://codeberg.org/lukeflo/bibiman) or [BibMan](https://github.com/ductri/BibMan).
However, they are not as feature-rich as JabRef.

The task is now to add a terminal UI based on [TamboUI](https://tamboui.dev/) build on top of JabRef.

This project requires **strong UX and Software Engineering skills**, because the TUI should not be just a copy of the current JabRef interface.
It should be untuivitevly and pleasent to use.

**Project size:**
