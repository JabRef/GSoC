Zotero is an alternative to JabRef with features focused on collaboration (and less on BibTeX quality). Zotero offers a [Storage](https://www.zotero.org/storage). It would be great if JabRef could synchronize with the storage.

Zotero offers an [API](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/start) to access the data. It should be used to synchronize data from and to Zotero.

Special attention should be put on synchronization of data if the local BibTeX file changes in parallel. Different scenarios of synchronization should be regarded. This knowledge should also be used to enhance the git support and OneDrive/Dropbox support.
